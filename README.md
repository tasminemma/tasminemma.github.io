# Welcome to [my website](https://tasminemma.github.io)! (or, its [repository](https://github.com/tasminemma/tasminemma.github.io))

This is my website in progress. I've gotten tired of having bits of me spread around and held hostage by different social medias like Instagram and Linkedin, so I'm embarking on a journey to make my own space on the internet where *I* control the narrative. I'll document my progress as much as possible through this process; feel free to follow along! ðŸ˜¸

## Aims

Through this experiment, I want to achieve 2 outcomes:

1. Create a functional personal website
2. Learn HTML and CSS

## Resources I'm using

- <a href="https://freecodecamp.org" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a>

  - Currently doing the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/" target="_blank">Responsive Web Design</a> Certification.

- <a href="https://badwebsite.club/" target="_blank">Bad Website Club</a>

  - I am currently following their <a href="https://badwebsite.club/webdev-bootcamp-jan-2024.html" target="_blank">Web Development bootcamp</a> as I go through FCC.
  - They're also running a <a href="https://badwebsite.club/js-bootcamp-feb-2024.html" target="_blank">JavaScript bootcamp</a> at the moment which I hope to catch up with once I'm done with HTML/CSS.

## What I'm struggling with currently

- HTML is cumbersome! I'm used to writing mostly in Markdown and have yet to see what learning HTML above writing in Markdown and converting it is good for. In the FCC Cat Photos App challenge, there were buttons I could code with HTML that Markdown wouldn't make, but is there a value beyond that?

  - More importantly, must I write everything in HTML for my site to run without Jekyll? I'd like to use Markdown to make posts.
