# Welcome to [tasminemma.github.io](https://tasminemma.github.io)!

I am currently learning how to build a website. I've gotten tired of having bits of me spread around and held hostage by different social medias like Instagram and Linkedin, so I'm embarking on a journey to make my own. It's going to be great. 😸

## Aims

Through this experiment, I want to achieve 2 outcomes:

1. Create a functional personal website
2. Learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript

## Resources I'm using

- <a href="https://freecodecamp.org" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a>

  - Currently doing the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/" target="_blank">Responsive Web Design</a> Certification.

- <a href="https://badwebsite.club/" target="_blank">Bad Website Club</a>

  - They're currently running a <a href="https://badwebsite.club/js-bootcamp-feb-2024.html" target="_blank">JavaScript bootcamp</a> which I hope to catch up with, but I am currently following their <a href="https://badwebsite.club/webdev-bootcamp-jan-2024.html" target="_blank">Web Development bootcamp</a> as I go through FCC. 

## Where to find me

Click <a href="https://github.com/tasminemma/tasminemma.github.io/" target="_blank">here</a> to access the repository behind this website on Github. Feel free to check out <a href="https://github.com/tasminemma" target="_blank">my profile</a> while you're at it.  

Full disclosure: I have more private repositories than public, as most of my repos are my plain text notes. I've also recently decided to make my contributions to my private repos public because I think the green thing is mega cool.
