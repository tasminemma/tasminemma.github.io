<p>
  I am currently learning how to build a website. I've gotten tired of having my data spread around and held hostage by different social medias like Instagram and Linkedin, so I'm embarking on a journey to make my own. It's going to be great. ðŸ˜¸

  Full disclosure: I have more private repositories than public, as most of my repos are my plain text notes. I've also recently decided to make my contributions to my private repos public because I think the green thing is mega cool.
