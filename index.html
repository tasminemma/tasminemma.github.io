<h1>Welcome to <a href="https://tasminemma.github.io">tasminemma.github.io</a>!</h1>

<h2>About this site</h2>

<p>This is my website in progress. I've gotten tired of having bits of me spread around and held hostage by different social medias like Instagram and Linkedin, so I'm embarking on a journey to make my own space on the internet where <em>I</em> control the narrative. I'll document my progress as much as possible through this process; feel free to follow along! ðŸ˜¸</p>

<h2>Aims</h2>

<p>Through this experiment, I want to achieve a few outcomes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a functional personal website that has:
    <ul>
      <li>An about me section that lets the right people know the right things.</li>
      <li>Cool styling. I want the website to be nice to look at (and for the purposes of this project, I don't want to rely on others' Jekyll themes to help me get there).</li>
      <li>Decent navigation.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript along the way.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Earning a certification would be a plus, but not necessary.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<h2>Resources I'm using</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://freecodecamp.org" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Currently doing the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/" target="_blank">Responsive Web Design</a> Certification.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://badwebsite.club/" target="_blank">Bad Website Club</a>
    <ul>
      <li>They're currently running a <a href="https://badwebsite.club/js-bootcamp-feb-2024.html" target="_blank">JavaScript bootcamp</a> which I hope to catch up with, but I am currently following their <a href="https://badwebsite.club/webdev-bootcamp-jan-2024.html" target="_blank">Web Development bootcamp</a> as I go through FCC. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<p>This website is hosted on Github Pages, which only allows for static websites. It also uses the site builder Jekyll, which I might deactivate with a .nojekyll file (once I figure out if I have to use it, LOL).</p>

<p>Being a static site, I cannot play around with more interactive elements of web development (although at the moment I have literally no idea what that entails), and I worry about losing track of my pages along the way as I keep building this.</p>

<p>I also have my concerns about scaling this up if I were to focus more on the content of my website (e.g. writing, building a portfolio), as coding this manually takes more time than if I were to use a platform like Wordpress to build myself a website.</p>

<h2>Where to find me</h2>

<p>Click <a href="https://github.com/tasminemma/tasminemma.github.io/" target="_blank">here</a> to access the repository behind this website on Github. Feel free to check out <a href="https://github.com/tasminemma" target="_blank">my profile</a> while you're at it.</p>

<p>Full disclosure: I have more private repositories than public, as most of my repos are my plain text notes. I've also recently decided to make my contributions to my private repos public because I think the green thing is mega cool.</p>
